## Usage
This repo is based off the existing source code provided here: `https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli` The site was refactored using GraphQL API to better accommodate the demands of personalized user data. Queries and Mutations were added to fetch and modify data, middleware was modified within the context of GraphQL, and an Apollo Provider was added to communicate with the Apollo Server.
