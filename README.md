# Google Book Search using MERN

## Description
This book search engine allows a user to search for a book using keywords. A list of books then displays with an image, author, and description. Users can then save books (once logged in) to review later, or delete them from their local storage. This project had the initial code provided and then was modified to use GraphQL.

## Usage
This repo is based off the existing source code provided here: `https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli` The site was refactored using GraphQL API to better accommodate the demands of personalized user data. Queries and Mutations were added to fetch and modify data, middleware was modified within the context of GraphQL, and an Apollo Provider was added to communicate with the Apollo Server.
